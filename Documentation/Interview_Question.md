Containers

It is appropriate to use containers in cloud deployments when setting up multiple identical machines. By using containers for the installation of necessary software it is simple to ensure that all machines have identical installations and to set them up all at the same time. The security benefits of using containers is that a container is a lightweight machine installed directly on one virtual machine, called the jump box. By using the container installed on the jump box, the virtual machines are only accessible from this one virtual machine which makes them more secure. In Project 1 an ansible container was installed on the jump box. Using the ansible container to install the monitoring services metricbeat and filebeat directly onto the identical web server virtual machines. It is appropriate to use the containers for this so that all of the installations are not done manually to ensure identical installation and because it only needs to be done once from the container to install on all machines simultaneously. The security benefits of using a container are the ability to easily update any of that packages on all virtual machines, the ability to easily change what packages get installed onto the virtual machines, and the fact that the installation packages are all in plain text so that it is clear what is being installed. In order to install and configure the ansible container the jump box must first install docker.io. Once docker is installed and started, install the container. For this project the ansible container was used. It is also important to configure the security group to allow ssh connectes from the jump box to all virtual machines within the network.

Without containers any packages that would need to be installed would first need to be installed to the jump box, then using scripts could be installed to the virtual machines. The disadvantage of doing this is that it would require manualing doing the installing on the jump box and keeping up with any updates. It also uses resources on the jump box. The disadvantage of using a container is that they are very lightweight without many security features. Also because they are lightweight it might seem easy to have multiple containers in use at a time which can use resoruces to run.
